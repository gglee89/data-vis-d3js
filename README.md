This is a Data Visualization project using D3.
Below is my notes compiled from the [Udacity's Data Visualization and D3.js](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud507) course

- What makes a good data visualization? *(by Cole Nussbaumer, People Analytics Manager @Google)*
> "It depends on the purpose of the DataViz. I tend to draw a disctiction between the **Exploratory** and the **Explanatory** where exploratory you're really trying to get a sense of *What the data is, what it can tell you?* is a process of turning over maybe 100 different rocks to try to find those, one or two interesting nuggets. Then once you found the interesting nuggets you're in the explanatory space of wanting to communicate those things to somebody else. When it comes to effective data visualization on the exploratory size, it's about allowing your users to be able to connect things in interesting ways and look at data frmo different angles in an unbiased and unleading way."
> "...the most successful explanatory data visualizations, make themselves a pivotal point in a story or a narrative that's being told."  - Cole Nussbaumer, [Website](www.storytellingwithdata.com/about/) & [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/colenussbaumer)

  - acquire & parse:
    - Data ingestion [Web scraping, log collection, database accesses, and et cetera. or ETL];
    - Data wrangling [MongoDB];
  - filter & mine:
    - Modeling, data mining, and exploratory analysis;
    - applying statistical and mathematical theory to discover insights;
    - EDA(Exploratory data analysis) [R, Python];
    - Modeling, statistics and machine learning;
  - represent, refine:
    - Experiment different visual encodings (Color, Shapes, Lines, Axis) to present data in the most effective manner;
    - Data Visualization [D3.js];
  - interact:
    - enable users to potentially discover insights for themselves;
